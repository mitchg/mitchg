- Hello fellow Humans

If you are in a time wasting frame of mind, and reading such stuff as this README, I will do my best to provide you with
something to occupy your time. I originally began using Github to document my forays into keeping track of my preferred Neovim configurations on Ubuntu. Like most of my projects, it is never kept sufficiently updated, but does help me to keep track of what I am currently doing. 

COMING SOON:
I plan to be adding a new  projects shortly. 
This is a database application using mysql to assist folks such as myself who have multiple neurological diagnosis, keep
track of personal symptoms, and attempt to associate and track specific symptoms, and groups of symptoms with specific
diagnosis that often have overlapping symptoms. A quick example is blurry vision and difficulty focusing your eyes are symptoms that 
could be related to Parkinson's, strokes, brainstem disease, as well as glaucoma. Another is balance problems which are related to multiple neurological diseases. More details to follow as this takes shape. 

As of now the db is mysql, front end is python, and the web will likely be apache2. I hope to have code to share soon.

Cheers for now,
Mitchg
